# Monte Carlo Markov Chain Sampling Method (MCMC)
MCMC algorithm & Gene Counting Algorithm 

This is Anabel's 2022 summer journey into computational biology and bioinformatics. Here is a list of concepts which are introduced in this folder:
1) Introduction to Bayesian statistics, and Bayesian parameters
2) Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm
3) Functional programming, statistical programming 

**edit: this is a messy folder where I dump my progress, most of the algorithm folders do not work except 3/4 important ones that I have not highlighted.
